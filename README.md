## Getting Started

To get started, first you'll need to copy this repository to your computer or laptop. For beginners, I recommend doing ["The Easy Way"](#the-easy-way). If you're up for some challenge or if you're comfortable with Git, then you should do ["The Git Way"](#the-github-way).

### The Easy Way

1. Click the green "Clone or download" button at the top of this repository.
2. Click "Download ZIP".
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file.

You'll have to do these steps each time we update the lessons. If you're tired of doing that, you should check out the other way below.

### The Git Way

#### Forking

1. Create and login to your GitHub account.
2. Click "Fork" at the top of this repository.

#### Cloning

1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Click the green "Clone or download" button at the top of the forked repository.
3. Copy the link that showed up.
4. Open a command line or terminal in the folder that you want to use.
5. Type `git clone <the copied url>`.
6. Type `cd <name of repository>` to go inside the cloned folder.

#### Changing

1. After you've made some changes, type `git add *`.
2. Then type `git commit -m "<describe what you changed>"`.
3. Then type `git push`.

#### Updating

1. Click the green "Clone or download" button at the top of this repository.
2. Copy the link that showed up.
3. Open a command line or terminal in your repository folder.
4. Type `git remote add upstream <the copied url>`.
5. Type `git fetch upstream`.
6. Type `git pull upstream master`.

Now, everytime we update the lesson, you'll just have to type `git pull upstream master` to keep up with the updates.
